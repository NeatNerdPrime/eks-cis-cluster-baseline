# eks-cis-baseline

InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of AWS EKS, against [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/)'s CIS Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Benchmark version 1.0.1.

## Getting Started

It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a **"runner"** host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over **winrm**.

**For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.**

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.
